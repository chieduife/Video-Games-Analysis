### Project Overview
This data analysis project provides a comprehensive view of the video game store based in Bali, offering insights into various aspects including the game's title, release year, genre, publisher, and sales greater than 100,000 copies across regions like the European Union, Japan, and North America. By analyzing this dataset, I aim to uncover patterns and address questions that will enhance our understanding of the data. These questions include determining the genre with the highest representation, identifying the genre with the highest sales, ranking the top 10 publishers by sales, listing the top 10 best-selling games, pinpointing the year with the highest sales, and offering insights into the potential reasons behind this peak with the aid of an interactive dashboard.

 ## DATA ANALYSIS
  
 ### Project Structure
#### The project is organized into the following sections:
- Data Collection: This section delves into the process of obtaining the video game dataset, performing data validation, and preprocessing it to make it ready for analysis in Excel, utilizing Pivot tables.
  
- Excel pivot Table and Dashboard:This section showcases the Excel-generated interactive dashboard and reports ,presenting diverse insights into the video game store based in Bali.

- Analysis and Insights: I explored the insights and discoveries resulting from the data analysis, emphasizing trends, patterns, and intriguing findings.


### Result / Findings
While conducting the analysis, I uncovered several valuable insights and effectively addressed the questions outlined in the initial exploratory data analysis. These insights encompassed various significant findings, such as the identification of 10 distinct publishers, a total of 18 games sold, the top-selling title 'Wii Sports,' Nintendo emerging as the leading publisher, the 'Action' genre boasting both the highest game count and sales at 19.98%, and the standout year of 2008, characterized by its exceptional sales performance, which can be attributed to the outstanding performance of the 'Mario Kart Wii' game, which falls under the racing genre and was published by Nintendo. Notably, 'Wii Sports' also secured the top spot as the highest-selling game during this period, and Nintendo emerged as the leading publisher. To enhance the accessibility and interactivity of these insights, I incorporated a dashboard featuring a genre slicer. This convenient feature streamlines the exploration of specific genres, enabling a more focused and comprehensive examination across the diverse array of charts and visual representations.

### Recommendations
- Genre: Consider capitalizing on the popularity of the 'Action' genre, which has shown the highest game count and sales. Continue to develop and release action games, but also explore opportunities in other popular genres to diversify the game portfolio and cater to a broader audience.

- Number of Games: Given that there are a total of 18 games sold, focus on maintaining a steady release of new game titles to keep the product catalog fresh and engaging for customers. Aim to balance quality with quantity, ensuring each new game adds value to the portfolio.

- Total Games Sold: Continue to monitor and analyze the performance of games to maintain a trajectory of growth in total games sold. Pay special attention to the factors contributing to the exceptional sales of 'Wii Sports' and 'Mario Kart Wii' and apply those insights to future game development and marketing strategies.

- Highest-Selling Game: Leverage the success of 'Wii Sports' by promoting this title, possibly through bundles, special promotions, or remastered versions. Additionally, invest in developing sequels or games with similar appeal to capture the spirit of these high-performing titles.

- Best Publisher: As Nintendo has emerged as the leading publisher, continue to strengthen partnerships with Nintendo for exclusive titles or collaborations. Explore opportunities to work closely with top publishers to secure more high-quality game titles.

- Outstanding Year (2008): The exceptional sales performance in 2008, attributed to the success of 'Mario Kart Wii,' underscores the importance of releasing high-quality, well-marketed titles. Continue to invest in innovative game development and marketing strategies to replicate the success of 2008 in subsequent years.
